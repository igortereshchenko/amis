            "ZYRTEC (cetirizine HCl) can provide the allergy symptom relief you're looking for and is designed for long term use.. ALLERPET, a well-known brand of liquid that reduces cat allergen in the air, can be applied to your cats' coat (once a week) and is available from your local veterinarian. Alternatively, you can get a micro fiber cloth and just damp rub down the cats' coats to rid it of visible dander.. These measures will also help:. Keep pets out of the bedroom. . Clean the air in your home with HEPA filtered air purifiers to remove airborne dander. .  Vacuum frequently using a HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner that removes and permanently traps airborne allergens. Most regular vacuums will put some dust back into the air. HEPA filtered vacuums avoid this. . Install a high-efficiency filter on home climate control systems to prevent dander from re-circulating throughout the home. Put filters over register vents. Change both filters seasonally. This helps to get floating dander out of the air. . Wash hands thoroughly after playing with pets. Good hand washing will remove most of the dander on your hands. . Over the longer term, you can consider removing carpeting or spray with a denaturing carpet solution to deactivate pet allergens. . If you have pet allergies, but not seasonal allergies, open windows and use exhaust fans or box fans placed backwards in windows to remove airborne particles.",

If you're extending credit to your customers, you don't actually have cash in your bank that you'll need to run you're own daily operations.  For instance, payroll typically happens every 2 weeks, but you'll need to wait a total of 30 days for a customer to pay you.. . Exteding credits have an adverse affect on both working capital requirement and cash conversion cycle.  You're capital requirement is higher, while the cash conversion is longer.. . Offering credit to your customers is something that is difficult to avoid.  But, it doesn't mean that there aren't complex methods to shorten the cash conversion cycle.  It is simply more difficult to do .",

In your words, I sense that you have sound judgement; you have great deal of knowledges and like to get lost in good books. All that you know seem unfamiliar to most people, yet they are precious knowledge once is understood.. . You are smart and intellange, what you lack of is just some soical or interpersonal skills. It seems that you would not just go up and initiate a small talk with anyone, and that is not the style that we introvert prefer. You found that your conversation runs dry easily, it may be you know something that is deep and difficult to put into words. Something that need a right time and a right place to bring it out.. . I guess you are drawn to the people who has similar personality. What are the reason behind I cannot tell, and only you can find that reason. My fellow introvert, to mingle with people can be either challenging or easy. To do that, we first need to understand ourselves, for that is the first step of understanding people around you.. .

            "With a conventional bright field microscope, light from an incandescent source is aimed toward a lens beneath the stage called the condenser, through the specimen, through an objective lens, and to the eye through a second magnifying lens, the ocular or eyepiece. Most microscopes will have a built-in illuminator. The condenser is used to focus light on the specimen through an opening in the stage. After passing through the specimen, the light is displayed to the eye with an apparent field that is much larger than the area illuminated. The magnification of the image is simply the objective lens magnification (usually stamped on the lens body) times the ocular magnification.. Most people are usually aware of the use of the coarse and fine focus knobs, used to sharpen the image of the specimen. They are frequently unaware of adjustments to the condenser that can affect resolution and contrast. Some condensers are fixed in position others are focusable, so that the quality of light can be adjusted. Usually the best position for a focusable condenser is as close to the stage as possible. The bright field condenser usually contains an aperture diaphragm, a device that controls the diameter of the light beam coming up through the condenser, so that when the diaphragm is stopped down (nearly closed) the light comes straight up through the center of the condenser lens and contrast is high. When the diaphragm is wide open the image is brighter and contrast is low. . . . visite this site to learn how it used. http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jhope/lab/micro22.stm. . . this is more info. http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/methods/microscopy/microscopy.html"

            "Great question! I do believe that the most valuable life lesson is to never judge. We lose some of our best friendships (or relationships) by letting our brain tell us what our should feel. Not to say that this is not ever good, because there are times when it is crucial to use our brains instead of our feelings, but everyone is human in the end. None of us are perfect. No one is exactly like another. We as human beings tend to accept was is most like ourselves, but by judging another person by a race, religion or belief, we automatically set up a wall created from negativity to keep that person away from our hearts. No one is going to be exactly like me, and if I keep looking for that nonexistent person, I will have wasted valuable time and turned down some great relationships. These are just my two cents. : )",

First, \"Be Most Excellent to One Another.\" In other words, be kind to one another. Take care of each other.. . Second, \"Party On!\" Enjoy life. Do what you love and love what you do. Find happiness even in the smallest things, here and now.",

            "I can provide you non-owner financing all the way to 90% LTV.  I work for a national bank and can lend in most states.  On a 30 year fixed today the approximate rate would be 8.75% with a 1% loan fee and .500 in discount or 7.25 with a 1% loan fee and 2% in discount.  This is an in-house \"A\" loan product, not off market or sub-prime.. . Since you have no landlord experience, you would have to qualify for the entire payment regardless of anticipated rent. My toll fee number is 800971-4638, ext. 223.",
            "As others pointed out, there are investor lenders out there who do 100% financing. Another way is to partner up with someone who has money. If the profit margin is high enough, you can split it with the person who fronts you the cash.. . Regards.",
            "You can finance up to 100% of the property value. The only kicker is, the terms of your loan may not be as good. Higher interest rates or origination fees may abound. A simple way to figure whether or not this will be a good idea is to calculate your potential income and your expenses and initial sunk costs. This is a gross oversimplification and I would recommend that you speak to a qualified CPA before you make this leap. As usual, I recommend being very conservative in your estimates, assume a few worst case scenarios (ie no rental income between renters) and if the numbers still come out good... then go for it! :) Good luck!. . **EDIT. . I almost forgot to give you a specific loan type!! You can ask for an 80/20 loan. Where you get a traditional loan for 80% of the value with no PMI (private mortgage insurance), and get another 20% loan for the downpayment (this will be at a higher interest rate and you should pay this one down as quickly as possible). Ask your loan officer about this. They may also be able to offer you other alternatives. Good luck! :)"
