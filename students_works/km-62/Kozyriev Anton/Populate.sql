It will continue to accelerate and be integrated in different ways to solve problems and achieve results. Start caring about upgrades. Data shows people don’t upgrade and this results in tremendous liability. Some companies have an effort to look inside and start licensing components by hand to look at risk and to know what’s going on. Security and legal need to work together to assess risk.');

It has its own advantages like bugs in OS will fix at a rapid pace and disadvantages like developers may take advantage of any weakness in OS if they found. 2) Linux has various distributions which are highly customizable based on user needs. 3) In Linux with GPL- Licensed operating system, users are free to modify the software, can re-use in any number of systems and even they can sell the modified version. 4) Linux is more secure than windows where hackers or developers of viruses will find difficult to break through Linux. 5) All software in Linux is free!');

Actively developed by Offensive Security, it’s one of the most popular security distributions in use by infosec companies and ethical hackers. One of the best things about Kali is the fact that it doesn’t require you to install the OS in your hard drive — it uses a live image that can be loaded in your RAM memory to test your security skills with the more than 600 ethical hacking tools it provides. It includes numerous security-hacker tools for information gathering, vulnerability analysis, wireless attacks, web applications, exploitation tools, stress testing, forensic tools, sniffing and spoofing, password cracking, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and much more. We’ve previously explored the Top 20 OSINT Tools available, and today we’ll go through the list of top-used Kali Linux software.');
